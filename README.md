## ⚙️ How It Works

1. User selects an emotion by clicking a button.
2. Each button contains a `data-emotion` attribute.
3. JavaScript listens for the click event.
4. Based on the selected emotion:
   - A random message is chosen from a predefined array.
5. A styled card appears displaying the message.
6. The user can close the card.
